## Quick Rundown
You've been employed by a company with plenty of energy to
sell but no customers to sell it to! It's your job
to build a city for them so that they can make some cash!

## Quick Start
You have a limited amount of energy, so it's important to find 
some energy sources. Click on the energy sources to replenish your 
energy. The next step is to builda city. You can only build roads 
and buildings next to existing roads so you will need to find a road. 
Buildings consume energy and eventually they run out and need to be 
charged up, click on a building to charge it. You will collect 
coins this way. Use these coins to fix broken energy sources 
so that you can survive and expand your city!
