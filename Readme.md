## Quick Rundown
You've been employed by BigPowerCorp who has plenty of energy to
sell but doesn't have any customers to sell it to! It's your job
to build a city so that BigPowerCorp can make some cash!

## Quick Start
You have a limited amount of energy, so it's important to find 
some BigPowerCorp energy sources. Click on the energy sources
to replenish your energy. The next step is to build a city.
You can only build roads and buildings next to existing roads
so you will need to find a road. Buildings consume energy and
eventually they run out and need to be charged up, click on
a building to charge it. You will collect coins this way.
Use these coins to fix broken energy sources so that you can
survive and expand your city!
