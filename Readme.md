## Quick Rundown
You've been employed by a company with plenty of energy to
sell but no customers to sell it to! It's your job
to Build a City so that you can make some cash!

## Quick Start
You have a limited amount of energy, so it's important to find 
some energy sources. Click on the energy sources to replenish your 
energy. The next step is to build a city. You can only build roads 
and buildings next to existing roads so you will need to find a road. 
Buildings consume energy and eventually they run out and need to be 
charged up, click on a building to charge it. You will collect 
coins this way. Use these coins to fix broken energy sources 
so that you can survive and expand your city!
