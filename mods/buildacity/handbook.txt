Employee Handbook

Welcome [name]! As our newest employee, your job is to sell our power to the world.

You see, we have invested $$$ in global energy supply infrastructure and now we need to induce some demand for it. So find some customers and well if you can't find any, just Build a City!

Most of our infrastructure is coin-operated so if you see sparks, that means it's time to deposit a coin. Any coins leftover? Well that's your salary and you are free to spend them as you please.

PS: Just don't damage your Power Craft
(That's Company Property).
