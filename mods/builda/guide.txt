Builda Guide

Welcome [name]! As our newest builda, your job is to sell power to the world.

You see, The Powers That Be have invested in a global energy supply infrastructure and now all that's left is to induce some demand...

The energy infrastructure is coin-operated so if you see sparks, that means it's time to deposit a coin. Any coins leftover? Well that's yours to spend how you please!

PS: Just don't damage your Power Craft
(That's company property).
